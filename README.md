# Project Title:
Using the support vector mechanism algorithm of supervised mechine learning,predict iris.csv dataset to findout the species will be same or different. 
# Problem Statement:
A American based Botanical garden grow iris flower in their labs but using bio technology in a single Tree different types of vareity flower is grow.Find out as a Data Science Enginner how much accuracy is there all category contain same species.

# Task 1: Preprocess the data in scikit.learn libery
# Task 2: Load the data using sklearn model selection default argument
# Task 3: On the basis of your dataset train test and split the SVM model
# Task 4: Import support vector mechanism classifier.The SVM must be "Linear"
# Task 5: Train the classifier on the training data
# Task 6: Find out the prediction value on the test data
# Task 7: Test the model with the help of accuracy, should be lie in the range of 0-1.

# Conclusion
According to my support vector mechanism model the species are linear.With the accuracy of 1.00.

Hence proved model was successfully implement.
